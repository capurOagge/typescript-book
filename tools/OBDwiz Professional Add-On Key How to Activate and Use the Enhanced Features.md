## What is OBDwiz Professional Add-On?
 
OBDwiz Professional Add-On is a software upgrade that enhances the functionality of OBDwiz, a PC-based scan tool software that is included with OBDLink adapters. OBDwiz allows you to connect your Windows device to your vehicle's OBD-II port and access a variety of diagnostic information, such as trouble codes, sensor data, freeze frames, and more.
 
OBDwiz Professional Add-On adds more features and diagnostics to OBDwiz, such as:
 
- Enhanced graphing: You can overlap multiple signals, add unlimited graphs, zoom, pan, and use cursors. Graphs are also customizable.
- Calculated PIDs: You can access calculated PIDs for Boost Pressure, Air-to-Fuel Ratio, Engine Power, Engine Torque, and Vehicle Acceleration.
- Data Mapping: You can view the value of one parameter based on two independent parameters. You can also switch between multiple data map views and select statistical parameters.
- Software sensor calibration: You can offset or scale any vehicle parameter and compensate for oversized tires (calibration in OBDwiz only).
- Custom and Enhanced PIDs: You can use the built-in GM enhanced PIDs to view enhanced data such as cylinder misfires. You can also import and add your own enhanced PIDs.
- On-board tests (Mode $08): You can perform on-board tests such as evaporative system leak test and diesel particulate filter regeneration.
- Custom trouble code definitions: You can define custom trouble code descriptions to be displayed when reading codes.

The availability of these features depends on your vehicle year, make, and model. Some features may require additional hardware or software.
