The novel explores the themes of love, lust, madness, guilt, and morality. It also examines the social and cultural norms of Kerala in the 1970s, such as the role of women, the institution of marriage, and the influence of religion. The novel uses various symbols to convey its messages, such as the moon, the sea, the snake, and the fire. For example, the moon represents Sumithra's beauty and femininity, but also her instability and madness. The sea represents Rajan's attraction and desire for Sumithra, but also his fear and danger. The snake represents Sumithra's seduction and temptation of Rajan, but also her venom and betrayal. The fire represents their passion and intensity, but also their destruction and ruin.
 
The main characters in Branth are Sumithra, Rajan, Sreedevi, Gopalan Nair, and Ravi. Sumithra is a young woman who works as a typist in a government office. She is beautiful, intelligent, and independent, but also restless and dissatisfied with her life. She is married to Gopalan Nair, a middle-aged man who is a clerk in the same office. He is dull, boring, and conservative, and does not understand or appreciate Sumithra's personality or needs. Rajan is a handsome and charming engineer who works in a private company. He is married to Sreedevi, a sweet and loyal woman who loves him dearly. He is happy with his marriage and career, but he is also curious and adventurous. He meets Sumithra at a party and is instantly attracted to her. Ravi is Sumithra's brother-in-law who lives with them. He is a young and naive college student who has a crush on Sumithra. He is unaware of her affair with Rajan.
