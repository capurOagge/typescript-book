I cannot thank you enough for saving me from a lot of frustration and trouble!! I was facing the same issue as many others who posted here and I spent days scouring the internet for a solution to make the new activation work, but you were the only one who figured it out!! It turns out that the cache file was the culprit that prevented me from entering the new serial number. I was so angry at Adobe for rendering what I paid a lot of money for useless. YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!
