Autodesk ForceEffect is a mobile simulation app that allows you to quickly and easily evaluate your design concepts for static loading conditions. You can create freehand sketches or import images and add functional mechanical joints, supports, loads and dimensions. You can also perform real-time solving and analysis of your design and export it to other CAD applications or share it with others via Autodesk 360.
 
But what if you want to use Autodesk ForceEffect on your PC? Unfortunately, Autodesk has retired the ForceEffect family of apps in 2018 and they are no longer available for download or support. However, there are some possible ways to still use ForceEffect on your PC, depending on your needs and preferences.

## Option 1: Use an Android Emulator
 
An Android emulator is a software that mimics the Android operating system on your PC, allowing you to run Android apps on your computer. There are many Android emulators available online, such as BlueStacks, NoxPlayer, MEmu, etc. You can download and install one of them on your PC and then search for the ForceEffect APK file online. An APK file is the installation package for Android apps. You can find some websites that still host the ForceEffect APK file, such as APKPure, APKMirror, etc. However, be careful when downloading APK files from unknown sources, as they may contain malware or viruses. Once you have the ForceEffect APK file, you can drag and drop it into the emulator and install it. Then you can launch the app and use it as you would on your mobile device.
 
## Option 2: Use Inventor 2016 R2
 
If you have access to Inventor 2016 R2, you can use the ForceEffect add-in that was included in this version of Inventor. The add-in allows you to use ForceEffect within the sketch environment of Inventor. To use the add-in, you need to check the add-in manager to see if it was listed and loaded. If not, you may need to reinstall Inventor 2016 R2 or contact Autodesk support for assistance. You also need to make sure that your firewall is not blocking the local host connection that the add-in uses. Once the add-in is loaded, you can access it from the sketch tab in Inventor and use it as you would on your mobile device[^1^].

## Option 3: Use an Alternative App
 
If none of the above options work for you, or if you prefer a different app that offers similar functionality as ForceEffect, you can look for some alternative apps that are available for PC. For example, Ftool is a free structural analysis program that allows you to create 2D frames and trusses and calculate their internal forces and displacements. It is not as user-friendly or intuitive as ForceEffect, but it offers more features and options for analysis. You can download Ftool from its official website and install it on your PC[^3^]. Another example is Autodesk ForceEffect Motion, which is a mobile simulation app that allows you to develop and test mechanical systems with moving parts. It is similar to ForceEffect but with more focus on kinematics and dynamics. It is also available on the App Store for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch[^2^]. You can use an Android emulator to run it on your PC as well.
 
## Conclusion
 
Autodesk ForceEffect was a great app that helped many engineers, students and hobbyists to quickly and easily evaluate their design concepts for static loading conditions. However, since it was retired in 2018, it is no longer available for download or support from Autodesk. If you still want to use ForceEffect on your PC, you can try one of the options mentioned above: using an Android emulator, using Inventor 2016 R2 or using an alternative app. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so you need to choose the one that suits your needs and preferences best.
