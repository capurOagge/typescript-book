One of the main features of Crysis 3 is the Nanosuit, which allows Prophet to switch between different modes that enhance his speed, strength, stealth, or armor. The Nanosuit also has a visor that can scan the environment and highlight enemies, weapons, and objectives. The Nanosuit can be customized with different modules that provide passive or active benefits, such as increased damage, faster movement, or cloaking.
 
Crysis 3 also has a variety of weapons and gadgets that can be used in combat. Some of the weapons are futuristic, such as the Predator Bow, which can fire different types of arrows, or the Typhoon, which can unleash a barrage of bullets in a split second. Some of the gadgets are useful for stealth or reconnaissance, such as the Hacking Tool, which can hack enemy devices and turrets, or the C4 Explosive, which can be remotely detonated. The weapons and gadgets can also be modified with attachments and upgrades that change their performance and appearance.
 
Crysis 3 has a single-player campaign that consists of seven missions, each with a different setting and objective. The campaign can be played on four difficulty levels: Rookie, Soldier, Veteran, and Super Soldier. The campaign also has collectibles that can be found throughout the levels, such as Nanosuit Upgrade Kits, Data Pads, and Blackboxes. Collecting these items can unlock achievements and trophies, as well as provide more information about the game's lore and backstory.
 
Crysis 3 also has a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players online. The multiplayer mode has 12 maps and eight game modes to choose from. Some of the game modes are standard ones, such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, or King of the Hill. Some of the game modes are unique to Crysis 3, such as Hunter, where two players in Nanosuits have to hunt down the other players who are CELL operatives; or Crash Site, where players have to secure and defend alien drop pods that land randomly on the map. The multiplayer mode also has a progression system that allows players to level up their rank and unlock new weapons, modules, dog tags, and skins.
