# How to Play Almost 1000 Classic NES Games on Your PC with FCE Ultra
 
If you are a fan of retro gaming, you might have a collection of old Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridges lying around. But what if you don't have the original console or a working controller? Or what if you want to play some rare or obscure games that are hard to find or expensive to buy?
 
Fortunately, there is a solution: emulation. Emulation is the process of using software to mimic the hardware and functionality of another system. With emulation, you can play NES games on your PC, using your keyboard, mouse, or a gamepad. You can also enjoy features like save states, cheats, filters, and more.

After loading a ROM, the game will start automatically. You can use your keyboard or a gamepad to control the game. By default, the keyboard controls are:

- Z: A button
- X: B button
- Enter: Start button
- Backspace: Select button
- Arrow keys: Directional pad

You can change these controls by clicking on Config > Input or pressing Alt+I. You can also configure a gamepad by clicking on Config > Gamepad or pressing Alt+G.
  
## Customizing the Settings and Controls
 
FCE Ultra has many options and features that you can customize to enhance your gaming experience. For example, you can:

- Save and load your game progress at any point by using save states (File > Save State or Load State)
- Cheat in games by using built-in cheat codes or adding your own (Tools > Cheats)
