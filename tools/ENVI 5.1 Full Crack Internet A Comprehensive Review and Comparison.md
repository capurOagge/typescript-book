The 32-bit mode is useful if you want to use ENVI with ArcGIS, which requires 32-bit compatibility. To launch ENVI in 32-bit mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the Windows Start menu.
2. Find the ENVI x.x folder, where x.x is the software version.
3. Click on ENVI x.x (32-bit) to start the program.
