**DOWNLOAD ->->->-> [https://t.co/fVctTfG8TI](https://t.co/fVctTfG8TI)**


 
1. Download the game from a reliable source. You can find the original DOS version of Championship Manager 2 on [My Abandonware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/championship-manager-2-2r3)[^1^], or the updated 96/97 version on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/ChampionshipManager9697DOS)[^3^]. You can also download the ISO files if you prefer to mount them as virtual CDs.
2. Install a DOS emulator. Since Championship Manager 2 is a DOS game, you will need an emulator to run it on your PC. One of the most popular and easy-to-use emulators is [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/), which you can download for free from its official website.
3. Configure DOSBox. After installing DOSBox, you will need to edit its configuration file (dosbox.conf) to set up some parameters. For example, you can increase the amount of memory (memsize) to 32 or 64 MB, enable sound (sbtype=sb16), and adjust the CPU cycles (cycles=max). You can also create a mount point for your game folder (mount c c:\cm2) or your ISO file (imgmount d c:\cm2.iso -t iso).
4. Launch the game. Once you have configured DOSBox, you can launch it and type the commands to run Championship Manager 2. For example, if you mounted your game folder as C:, you can type c: and then cm2.exe to start the game. If you mounted your ISO file as D:, you can type d: and then install.exe to install the game first, and then run cm2.exe from the installation folder.
5. Enjoy! You can now play Championship Manager 2 on your PC and relive the glory days of football management. You can also use some additional features of DOSBox, such as saving and loading states (CTRL+F5 and CTRL+F9), taking screenshots (CTRL+F5), or recording videos (CTRL+ALT+F5).

Note: Championship Manager 2 uses a "Laserlok" CD-ROM check system that may be incompatible with DOSBox. One solution is to use an alternative "DOS Extender" system-layer to replace the one the game comes withâRational Systems' popular DOS/4GWâwhich the Laserlok system relies on. For example, the open-source DOS/32 (official site: http://dos32a.narechk.net/) can be used[^2^]. To do so, after installing the game, download the latest DOS/32 binary distribution and extract the .EXE files into the game's installation directory. Now run the following DOS command from this folder: DOS32A.EXE CM2.EXE
  
Championship Manager 2 is widely regarded as one of the best football management games ever made. It was developed by Sports Interactive, the same studio that later created the Football Manager series. It offers a realistic and immersive simulation of managing a football club, from scouting players and staff, to setting tactics and formations, to dealing with finances and media.
