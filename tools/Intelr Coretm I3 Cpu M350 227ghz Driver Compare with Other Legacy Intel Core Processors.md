Championship Manager 01/02 is a classic football management game that was released in 2001. It is still popular among fans who enjoy its realistic simulation and extensive database of players and teams. However, if you want to play this game on a modern PC, you may encounter some problems with the CD protection. The game requires you to insert the original CD every time you launch it, which can be inconvenient and risky for your disc. Fortunately, there are some ways to bypass this requirement and play the game without a CD.
 
One of the easiest methods is to use a no-CD patch that modifies the game executable files and removes the CD check. There are several versions of these patches available online, depending on the patch level of your game. The latest official patch for Championship Manager 01/02 is v3.9.68, which you can download from the official website or from various fan sites. However, if you have an older version of the game, such as v3.9.60 or v3.9.62, you can also find no-CD patches for them.

To use a no-CD patch, you need to first install the game and apply the official patch that matches your game version. Then, you need to download the corresponding no-CD patch and extract it to your game directory, replacing the original CM0102.EXE and CM0102\_GDI.EXE files with the ones from the patch archive. After that, you can run the game without inserting the CD.
 
Another method is to use a no-CD loader that tricks the game into thinking that the CD is present. This is a small program that you need to run before launching the game. It creates a virtual drive and mounts an image of the game disc on it. The game then detects this image as the CD and allows you to play. One of the advantages of this method is that it does not modify any game files, so it is less likely to cause compatibility issues or errors.
 
To use a no-CD loader, you need to install the game and apply the official patch that matches your game version. Then, you need to download the no-CD loader and extract it to your game directory. You also need to have an image of the game disc in ISO or BIN/CUE format, which you can create using a program like ImgBurn or Alcohol 120%. After that, you need to run the loader and select the image file when prompted. Then, you can run the game without inserting the CD.
 
Both methods have their pros and cons, so you can choose the one that suits you best. However, before using any of them, make sure that you have a legal copy of the game and that you are not violating any copyright laws or terms of service. Also, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources and scan them for viruses or malware before opening them.
