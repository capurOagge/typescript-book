Detention is a 2D atmospheric horror game that takes place in a fictional 1960s Taiwan under martial law. The game features a unique story, puzzles, and East Asian cultural references. If you are looking for a thrilling and immersive experience, you might want to download Detention and play it on your PC.
 
However, downloading Detention might not be as easy as you think. The game is not available on some popular platforms like Steam or GOG. You might have to resort to torrenting, which is a risky and illegal activity that can expose you to malware, viruses, and legal troubles. Therefore, you should always use a VPN when downloading torrents to protect your privacy and security.

A VPN, or a virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address from prying eyes. By using a VPN, you can access blocked websites, avoid ISP throttling, and download torrents anonymously. There are many VPN providers out there, but not all of them are suitable for torrenting. You should look for a VPN that has fast speeds, unlimited bandwidth, strong encryption, a kill switch feature, and a no-logs policy.
 
One of the best VPNs for torrenting is Expert VPN. Expert VPN has over 3000 servers in 94 countries, including Taiwan. It offers blazing-fast speeds, unlimited bandwidth, AES-256 encryption, a kill switch feature, and a strict no-logs policy. Expert VPN also has a 30-day money-back guarantee and 24/7 customer support. You can get Expert VPN for only $6.67 per month with our exclusive deal.
 
Once you have installed and activated Expert VPN on your device, you can proceed to download Detention via torrent. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Go to one of the torrent websites that offer Detention, such as [YTS](https://yts.mx/movies/detention-2003), [Torgamez](https://torgamez.com/detention-2017/), or [The Pirate Bay](https://thepiratebay.fitness/series/detention/season/1). Make sure you use the official domains of these websites and avoid any fake or malicious ones.
2. Search for Detention using the keyword "Detention Torrent Download [Torrent]". You should see a list of results with different versions of the game. Choose the one that has the most seeders and leechers, as this indicates its popularity and availability.
